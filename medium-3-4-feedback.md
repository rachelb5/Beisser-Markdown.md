## Abuse in Sex Trafficking

[//]: # (Could you find some quotes from victims or police reports--anything to make the argument feel a bit more visceral (but, importantly, not exploitative)?)

Violence and assault against women have come into the spotlight recently, with new information coming to light about rape on college campuses, sexual harassment on social media, and Donald Trump’s comments about sexually harassing women during his 2016 campaign. With all of this new information, many young women have mobilized to fight to stop violence against women. Take Back the Night rallies have become popular on many college campuses, as has encouraging college women to report rape and other sexual assaults, and volunteering organizations focused on helping women who are victims of violence. This recent focus on the violent repression of women has also brought to light just how many women are affected by violence committed by men. While all of this new information has brought many new young women into the fight, one facet of violence against women that is sometimes ignored is the violence that often accompanies sex trafficking.

While sex trafficking is often seen as an act of violence against women in and of itself, there is also physical and mental brutality, sexual or otherwise, that affects sex slaves. Because sexual slavery is often addressed as a specific and isolated issue, which it certainly is, it is also important to confront the issue of violence against women that so frequently accompanies sex trafficking. By connecting the violence committed against women and girls in the sex industry to other forms of violence against women, I believe we will be able to address human trafficking better as a whole.

Violence against women who are sex slaves is all too common. In an industry built around the subjugation of women and forcing them to engage in unwanted sexual activity, violence often occurs as a means to force women into submission and to create fear of running away. Sexual slavery, like all other forms of slavery, often entails creating an emotional and physical fear of those in charge, rendering rebellion unconsidered for fear of the consequences. Because women are forced to be sex slaves, violence ensures they fear their pimps and the physical ramifications of running away or going to authorities. There are too many accounts of former sex slaves being beaten into fear by their pimps, punished for not engaging in sex when they are told to, and being raped by men who purchased them. Because it is violence that so often prevents women and girls from getting help, we must understand the physical and emotional abuse sex slaves suffer in order to assist them.

Because sex trafficking is such a hidden industry, and pimps are so hard to catch, it is hard to determine exactly how much violence against women occurs. However, due to the fact that it is an illegal industry, and one based on the exploitation and dehumanization of women, it is easy to imagine that violence against women is by no means a rarity. Most women who go to authorities and escape sexual slavery speak on how commonplace violence was while working for pimps. Women consulted for an article on sex trafficking spoke about the frequency and brutal nature of the violence committed against them, such as beatings, emotional bereavement, and different forms of torture.

Most of the girls consulted in the above article were minors. A majority of sex slaves in America are minors, typically 13–15 years old. The question of whether any sexual activity with a sex slave who is a minor is rape is a question that many lawmakers and advocates for girls’ rights pose. I would imagine that in areas that anyone who forces a minor into prostitution or engages in sexual activity with them is illegal, it would be much easier to legally punish those who exploit them.

One form of violence that is frequently perpetrated against women in sex trafficking aside from beatings is rape and sexual assault. This issue is very difficult to address, largely because of the common perception that sex slaves willingly partake in sexual acts, and that their work means that they can’t be raped because it’s their “job.” However, the fact is that sex slaves are forced to prostitute themselves, which can be seen as rape in and of itself. These women have not consented to engage in sexual acts themselves, but are told to do so. Likewise, it does not take a stretch of imagination to understand that simply because these women engage in sex acts means they always consent to men buying them. If a sex slave feels uncomfortable engaging in intercourse, it is not likely men using her will respect her wishes due to the fact that these women are often seen as property and are regarded as such. The nature of sex trafficking means that women are regarded as objects to be bought and sold rather than autonomous human beings, creating a culture that regards sex slaves as inhuman and means they are treated without respect.

Abuse in sex trafficking is a huge issue, and one that is largely unaddressed. In an age where violence agains women is coming into the spotlight, and with young women rising up to confront this epidemic, abuse and violence in sex trafficking needs to be dealt with by this movement as well. The role that sex trafficking plays in the violent oppression of women must be considered important in the fight against violence against women.

## Young women’s role in preventing sex trafficking

I believe that young women are a strong and under utilized force in the fight against sex trafficking. Sexual slavery largely affects adolescent girls and young adult women, so we then have a distinctive perspective and special ability to combat sex trafficking. Young women are the key to stopping human trafficking because, if trained correctly, we will be able to spot peers who are victims, reach out to victims on a more personal level than adults or men can, and relate to the struggle of victims in a deeper way. Exploring different ways to address sex trafficking is a great way for us to explore the options we have to stop sex trafficking.

The fight against human trafficking is a difficult one. Like other illegal industries, sex trafficking is hidden, disguised, and widespread. These elements make it difficult for authorities to track down and convict perpetrators; and the widespread nature of human trafficking only makes it harder to stop. Sexual slavery also varies greatly by country, and in the case of America, it greatly varies by state and region. All of these facts mean that people have very different opinions of what successful prevention measures are. We need prevention tactics at federal, state, local, and personal levels in order to address this industry.

At the federal level, the most important preventative law is the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA). This law is important in several ways, three of those reasons being the definition that any commercial sex act performed by a person under 18 is considered human trafficking, physical transportation from one region to another is not in the definition of human trafficking, and people trafficked from countries outside of the U.S can be given a “T-Visa” if they were subject to severe forms of trafficking.

At state and regional levels, prevention laws have subtle differences that make the prosecution of those who exploit sex slaves different by place. Many states define human trafficking and “coercion” differently, have different laws regarding the selling of minors, and have different punishments for those who sell and buy children. One way for us to become involved in the fight against human trafficking is to research our own state laws on the issue, and address shortcomings by contacting state legislators and representatives. Human trafficking tends to be a bipartisan issue, and it can be effective to rally groups to campaign for better laws to prevent human trafficking. Having young women speak out politically on sexual slavery would be a powerful way to demonstrate that it adversely affects us; and, that we possess a unique voice in the fight against sexual slavery.

Unfortunately, reaching out to federal, state, and local government officials is not always successful, and often people don’t get a response. A great way to combat sex trafficking apart from official laws is to make personal efforts to address trafficking. Personal measures to stop human trafficking can often be the most effective way to combat the sex industry. Whether it be starting or contributing to nonprofit organizations who help trafficking victims, noticing the signs that point to possible victims, reporting suspicious behavior to police officers, or giving money to organizations against sex trafficking, these small actions make a difference.
One way young women can strongly affect preventing trafficking is in noticing signs of their peers’s victimization. Because of our closeness and proximity to other young women, we have a special role to play in catching indications that another woman may be trafficked or be in danger of being trafficked. If we train ourselves on the signs of victimization, such as anxiousness or paranoia (especially when law enforcement is mentioned), showing signs of physical and emotional abuse, not clarifying where she goes/lives, and not being able to come and go as she pleases, we can help women in these situations and report suspicious behavior if necessary. Likewise, we can train ourselves to recognize who potential victims are and reach out to them to ensure they are safe. Young women who are homeless or who have run away, whose parent’s are abusive or uninvolved with their lives, and girls who have been abused are much more likely to be singled out by traffickers.

I believe young women should also have a special place in talking with women who were formerly trafficked. As a woman, I am much more comfortable talking to other women, specifically within my age group, about issues I am facing and problems in my life. I believe that women who have been trafficked may potentially be more willing to talk about their experiences with other young women. While I think that professional counselors should definitely communicate with victims, I think that young women can also serve a special function in helping former victims discuss their emotions. Young women tend to face specific types of sexualization, exploitation, and misogyny that will help them identify with and communicate better with victims of sexual slavery.

If Americans decide to take steps to federally and locally combat human trafficking; and, if young women are given a special voice in stopping sexual slavery, I believe much progress will be made in preventing sex trafficking. I think that young women have a unique role to play in prevention, and should use their power and understanding to help victims. When we take notice of the small things, and take even minor actions against slavery, we will begin to make a change in the sex trafficking industry.
